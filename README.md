# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This repository contains various implementations of popular data structure and algorithms in my journey towards mastering DSA. It also contains solutions of multiple leetcode questions. I'll be constantly updating this repository through out my journey. So stay ðŸ‘€


## Future Plans
At the moment most of these implementations are written in Python, my plan is to expand this repository to include implementations in other languages such as:
- C++
- Scala
- JavaScript
